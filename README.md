# ODEPlotter
A MatPlotLib Python Ordinary Differential Equation Direction Field Plotter with Solution Curves

In this example, the color of the slope lines represents how close the slope is to zero (horizontal). Green means 0, red means non-zero.

Each blue point is an initial condition, and the blue curves are the initial conditions' solution curves found by moving a tiny amount left or right, using the ODE to find the slope, and moving that much multiplied by the tiny amount.
